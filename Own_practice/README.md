# üêç Python Practice Problems Collection

This folder contains beginner to intermediate Python practice problems organized by concept and challenge type. These were solved as part of my daily roadmap progress and include CLI-based problem-solving, basic logic building, and CS50/MIT-inspired exercises.

## üìÅ Folder Overview

| Folder Name             | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `collatz_sequence`      | Implements the Collatz conjecture algorithm for any positive integer |
| `even_odd`              | Basic conditional check to determine if a number is even or odd |
| `even_odd_till_input`   | Loops until user enters a stop value, checking even/odd status |
| `guess_game`            | Simple number guessing game using random number generation |
| `Mini Projects`         | Contains small CLI projects like calculator, quiz, etc. |
| `multiples_of_3`        | Prints multiples of 3 within a range |
| `Nsat prep`             | NSAT-style Python coding problems for exam prep |
| `password_retry`        | Login simulation with retry attempts and limit enforcement |
| `prime_checker`         | Checks whether a number is prime |
| `Pyramids`              | Pattern printing with nested loops (pyramids, triangles) |
| `sum_of_digits`         | Sums the individual digits of a number |
| `web dev`               | Starting point for web development projects or HTML/CSS practice |

## ‚úÖ Skills Practiced

- Python fundamentals (I/O, conditionals, loops)
- CLI-based input/output design
- Pattern generation and nested logic
- Logic building for exam-style problems (e.g., NSAT)
- Modular coding for future projects

## üöÄ How to Run

```bash
python filename.py
```

Navigate to any subfolder and run the script file using Python 3. Example:

```bash
cd guess_game
python guess.py
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Part of Roadmap

These problems are part of my [Acey Roadmap](https://github.com/nolifer-jpg) ‚Äî Weeks 1 to 5 of Python mastery and problem-solving using real practice. More advanced projects are under development in Java, DSA, and AI folders.
