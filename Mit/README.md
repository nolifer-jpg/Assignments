## ðŸ“‚ Folders

### `Pset1`
- **Part A:** Implement basic Python programs such as counting vowels, reversing words, and implementing FizzBuzz.
- **Part B:** Identify the longest word in a sentence using Python string manipulation.
- **Part C:** Practice list, tuple, set operations for foundational understanding.

### `Pset2`
- **hangman.py:** Complete implementation of the classic Hangman game with:
  - 6 allowed guesses
  - 3 warnings for invalid inputs
  - Score calculation based on remaining guesses and unique letters in the word
  - Tracking available letters
  - User feedback after each guess

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries used â€” all standard Python features

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To master the fundamentals of Python programming and prepare for data structures, algorithms, and technical interviews through structured assignments.

---

## âœ… Next Steps
- Work on `Pset3` from MIT OCW
- Transition into Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C++ for deeper system understanding
