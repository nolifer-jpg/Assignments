MIT 6.0001 Problem Set 1 – Saving for a Dream House

This folder contains my solution to Problem Set 1 from MIT's 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python.

Problem Summary:
----------------
The goal is to determine how many months it will take to save for the down payment on a dream house.

You're given:
- Your annual salary
- The portion of salary saved each month
- The total cost of the dream house
- The annual investment return rate (4%)

Files:
------
- pset1_partA.py: Simulates monthly savings using compound interest

Concepts Used:
--------------
- Loops (while)
- User input and validation
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Monthly interest compounding
- Clean variable naming and step-by-step logic

Sample Output:
--------------
Enter your annual salary: 120000
Enter the percent of your salary to save, as a decimal: 0.1
Enter the cost of your dream house: 1000000
Months required: 183

Next Step:
----------
[ ] Part B – Use binary search to find the best savings rate for a fixed time (36 months).
