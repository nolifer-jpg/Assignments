# ðŸ§  MIT 6.0001 â€“ Lecture 2 Projects (Python)

This repository contains beginner-level CLI projects and exercises built after completing **Lecture 2** of MITâ€™s [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/).

## âœ… What I Built
- âœ… Even/Odd Checker  
- âœ… Multiples of 3 Printer  
- âœ… Sum of Digits Calculator  
- âœ… Prime Number Checker  
- âœ… Guess the Number Game (with replay & attempts counter)

Each program uses:
- Functions
- Control flow (`if`, `else`, `while`)
- Input/output
- Python standard library (`random`)

## ðŸ“Œ Next up 
- Recursive challenges from Lecture 3  
- Weekly blog posts on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com) and Dev.to

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Clone the repo and run any script:

```bash
python3 even_odd/even_odd.py
python3 guess_game/guess_the_number.py
```

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

I'm building a strong computer science foundation by solving every lecture's problem set and creating fun CLI projects along the way.
