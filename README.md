# 📘 MIT + Harvard CS Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to programming assignments and lecture projects from:

- [MIT 6.0001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)
- [Harvard CS50P (Python)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)

## 📂 Folder Structure

- `lecture_1/` – Basics: input/output, conditionals, loops
- `lecture_2/` – Functions, recursion, control flow projects
- `mini_projects/` – Small CLI apps (BMI calculator, palindrome checker, etc.)

## 🚀 Goals

- Build core CS fundamentals using real university lectures
- Solve every problem set and document learning
- Push all code regularly to GitHub

## 📌 Status

✅ Lecture 1 Complete  
✅ Lecture 2 Complete  
⏳ Lecture 3 (Recursion) – In Progress
