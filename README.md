# 🧠 MIT 6.0001 & CS50P Assignments

This repository contains my solutions and notes from two foundational programming courses:

- [MIT 6.0001: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/)
- [CS50P: Harvard's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/)
