# 🧪 Own Practice – Java Exercises

This folder contains a collection of practice problems written in Java to reinforce logic, control flow, and user input/output handling. Each subfolder represents a standalone exercise that focuses on specific programming concepts.

These were written as warm-ups and personal experiments to grow beyond structured tutorials.

## 🧠 Purpose

These exercises help in:
- Sharpening logic-building skills
- Practicing input validation and flow control
- Becoming fluent with core Java syntax (loops, `Scanner`, conditions)

## 🛠️ How to Run

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

Each folder contains a `.java` file with a `main()` method ready to run.
